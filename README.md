## Computational Power

|           |   CPU   |   GPU   |   FPGA    |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Latency   | fastest |  fast   |   fast    |
| Throughput| too low |  high   |   high    |
| Power     | medium  |  high   |   low     |
| Access    | easy    |  medium |   hard    |
